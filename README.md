## Overview

This project implements a Specific Provisioner that provision HDFS Storage for a CDP Private environment.

### What's a Specific Provisioner?

A Specific Provisioner is a microservice which is in charge of deploying components that use a specific technology. When the deployment of a Data Product is triggered, the platform generates it descriptor and orchestrates the deployment of every component contained in the Data Product. For every such component the platform knows which Specific Provisioner is responsible for its deployment, and can thus send a provisioning request with the descriptor to it so that the Specific Provisioner can perform whatever operation is required to fulfill this request and report back the outcome to the platform.

You can learn more about how the Specific Provisioners fit in the broader picture [here](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p2_arch/p1_intro/#deploy-flow).

### CDP Private Cloud Base

CDP Private Cloud Base is a solution that enables organizations to deploy and manage their data infrastructure in a private cloud environment. This private cloud deployment is designed to offer enhanced security, control, and compliance for sensitive data, making it suitable for businesses with strict regulatory requirements or those who prefer to keep their data within their own infrastructure.

Explore CDP Private Cloud further consulting the [official documentation](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/index.html).

### HDFS

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a Java-based file system for storing large volumes of data. Designed to span large clusters of commodity servers, HDFS provides scalable and reliable data storage.
